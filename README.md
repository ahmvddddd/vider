# Vider

**Vider** is a freelancer app that connects clients with service providers within their location.  
This app allows users to:

1. Search for service providers nearby using maps.  
2. View service provider portfolios and details of the services they render.  
3. Exchange text messages with service providers.  
4. Send job requests to service providers.  
5. Make crypto payments after completing each job.  

The app is built with **Flutter** for the frontend, **Node.js** for the backend, and **MongoDB** for data storage.

## Architecture

The app follows a **Modelâ€“Viewâ€“Controller (MVC)** software architecture:

- **Models**  
  Represent the data and business logic of the application.  
  Examples:  
  - `user_model` (username, lastname, etc.)  
  - `job_model` (duration, status, etc.)  

- **Views**  
  Represent the **UI elements** visible to the user.  
  Examples: Login screen, Dashboard, Job listings.  

- **Controllers**  
  Handle user input, process requests, and decide what data from the Model goes to the View.  
  Example: `transaction_controller` fetches transactions from the backend and displays transaction details in the transaction history screen using the `transaction_model`.  

 All **state management** logic is handled with **flutter_riverpod**.
